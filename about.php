							Every thing we do and every effort we put forward for the sake of Allah and for propagation and establishment of his religion, is a work that is part of our religion, we are living in an age of achieving academic excellence and intellectual superiority, today's human being, on the basis of his research, analysis and investigations is trying to guide his heart and mind to the right path. So it is necessary that we and our modern generation have direct access to the primary and original sources of the Islam which we are engaged in by education and preaching. Teachers before teaching students, also must have a deep study of every science,its principals instructions formulated by the experts and then deliver their lectures imbued with satisfactory traditional and intellectual arguments in front of students. The students in path of learning must comply with principles of research and and analysis and must not confine themselves to the boundary of their course book, instead raising their academic status they must have direct reach to books of the experts, and must adopt research based approach towards every branch of knowledge they study and must examine every information on the basis of traditional and rational standard.This approach will enable them to perform the services of spreading Islamic sciences in modern age with all the beauty and perfection.

							Dear students! Human being does not become scholar from womb of the mother. Instead, it is consistent hard work , prolonged struggle and devotion in the way of learning which make scholars and experts. Religious Knowledge is the basis of all good things and without religious knowledge a person's life and all his prayers are incomplete, as through knowledge we come to know our lord and creator, we invoke purpose of our creation and lead a dignified life with endured praise in the world. Obtaining blessing of both world and propagation of Islam is our life time goal which can be achieved only through acquiring knowledge. The Knowledge which creates a sense of humility and repentance, really helps to attain Allah's Knowledge. Greater knowledge makes man greater in humbleness and morality. A good scholar and a devout cleric is a role model for the society and future generations , and a saviour of his people from the torment of Duniya and Akhirah. Dear students! You are here to be future ideals, so spend your time in learning with dedication and hard work and try to be a source of salvation from hellfire for your parents, well wishers and a bounty for whole world. it is only possible when we get education for the sake of Allah and act accordingly for the pleasure of Allah his beloved prophet.
